# Visualize and Communicate Data
## Mathematics and Statistics for Data

### Basic Concepts of Statistics
- Recall the basic concepts of statistical functions (minimum, maximum, sum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation) and how to apply them to data sets;

- Apply statistical functions to a data set using the pandas and numpy libraries in Python;

- Analyze the results obtained from statistical functions to interpret the distribution and variation of the data, correlating the information to identify patterns and insights. 

### Data correlation
- Understand the concepts of strength and direction of correlation between variables, recognizing how these properties affect data interpretation;

- Analyze different types of correlation (Pearson and Spearman), evaluating the suitability of each method in different data analysis contexts;

- Apply normalization and standardization techniques to assess the impact of correlations between variables, demonstrating the ability to compare results before and after these transformations.
