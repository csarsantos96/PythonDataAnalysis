# Visualize and Communicate Data
## Mathematics and Statistics for Data

### Basic Concepts of Statistics
- Recall the basic concepts of statistical functions (minimum, maximum, sum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation) and how to apply them to data sets;

- Apply statistical functions to a data set using the pandas and numpy libraries in Python;

- Analyze the results obtained from statistical functions to interpret the distribution and variation of the data, correlating the information to identify patterns and insights. 

### Data correlation
- Understand the concepts of strength and direction of correlation between variables, recognizing how these properties affect data interpretation;

- Analyze different types of correlation (Pearson and Spearman), evaluating the suitability of each method in different data analysis contexts;

- Apply normalization and standardization techniques to assess the impact of correlations between variables, demonstrating the ability to compare results before and after these transformations.

### Regression Model

- Understand the difference between independent and dependent variables in a linear regression model, identifying which variables are used to predict other variables.

- Apply a simple linear regression model to predict values of a dependent variable, using the Python libraries pandas and scikit-learn.

- Evaluate the accuracy of a linear regression model using performance metrics such as the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) and root mean square error, comparing these values to the standard deviation of the data.

### Classification Model

- Understand the difference between classification models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, and how they can be used to categorize data into distinct classes;

- Apply logistic regression and decision tree models to classify data, implementing these models with Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib;

- Evaluate the effectiveness of classification models by comparing the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity results between logistic regression and decision trees to determine which model performs best with the given data.

### Application of Models

- Apply regression and classification models, previously trained, to new datasets to predict outcomes;

- Analyze the predictions generated by linear regression and logistic regression models, identifying how variables influence the results;

- Differentiate between the appropriate uses of regression and classification models, recognizing when each type of model should be applied in practical scenarios.
