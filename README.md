## 🔍 Code Quality Tools (PEP 8)

To ensure clean, consistent, and maintainable code, the following tools were used:

| Tool     | Description                               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `flake8` | Detects style guide violations (PEP 8)    |
| `black`  | Automatically formats Python code         |
| `pylint` | Evaluates code quality and gives a score  |

You can install them with:
```bash
pip install flake8 black pylint
