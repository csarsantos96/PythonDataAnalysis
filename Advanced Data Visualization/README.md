# Advanced Data Visualization

## Introduction to Plotly

- Apply the Plotly library to create interactive data visualizations;

- Analyze different types of charts and choose the most appropriate one to represent specific data;

- Evaluate the effectiveness of interactive charts generated with Plotly, considering factors such as clarity, interaction, and the ability to communicate complex information visually.

## Advanced Charting with Plotly

- Apply the Plotly, Dash, and Pandas packages to create interactive web applications with dynamic charts;

- Create an organized web application using charting and layout functions in Dash, as well as implement best practices for code organization and maintenance.

## Interactive Visualizations

- Add titles, paragraphs, checklists, and graphs to make the application more attractive and functional;

- Analyze the interactivity between inputs and outputs, identifying how changes in inputs are reflected in visual outputs.

## Finalizing Project Visualization
- Apply graphical visualizations to your statistical models;

- Analyze the correlation between variables using methods such as Pearson and Spearman correlations, visualizing these relationships in graphs to better interpret the results.

- Create interactive and customized visualizations to communicate the results of statistical models.
