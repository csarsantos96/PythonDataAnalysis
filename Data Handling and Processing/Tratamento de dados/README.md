# Data Preprocessing

- Understand the importance of data cleaning and correction to ensure its quality and avoid misleading conclusions in later analyses.

- Apply lambda expressions to simplify functions into a single line of code.

- Analyze the data structure using commands such as head(), tail(), info(), isnull(), and sum() to identify the presence of null values and outliers.

##  Data Cleansing

- Identify unnecessary columns and rows in a DataFrame and remove them to optimize the data;

- Perform text normalization and handle missing values in a DataFrame to standardize and complete the data;

- Demonstrate the ability to save a cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file using the df.to_csv() command.

## Treating Outliers

- Explain outlier identification methods, including Basic Filter, Z-score, and IQR.

- Implement outlier identification and removal in a DataFrame using the methods learned.

- Evaluate the influence of outliers on the data and decide on the best approach to address them, whether by removing or correcting them. 

## Treat inconsistent data

- Recognize data inconsistencies, such as incorrect date formats and non-standard categories.

- Use Lambda functions to mask personal data and correct text formats.

- Validate and correct data entries, such as addresses and CPFs, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the processed data.
