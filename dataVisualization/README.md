# Introduction to Data Visualization

## Data Visualization

- Understand the fundamental concepts of data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify the most appropriate chart types for different data sets;

- Create charts using parameter settings such as figure size, colors, axis labels, and titles to improve chart clarity and interpretation.

- Analyze visualized data to extract meaningful insights.

## Using Matplotlib
- Understand how to use the Matplotlib library to create different types of graphs;

- Apply customization techniques to graphs, configuring properties to improve data visualization and interpretation;

- Analyze the relationship between different variables using graphs to identify patterns and correlations in the data.

# Using Seaborn

- Compare the features of the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries;

- Apply graphs using the Seaborn library to identify patterns, trends, outliers, and the distribution of variables;

- Analyze the correlation between multiple variables in a data set.
